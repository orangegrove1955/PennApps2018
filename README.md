# PennApps2018
PennApps project built in 2018

## Inspiration
We kept getting lost in the Penn Engineering building because we don't understand hallways and rectangles. So we made an app that can show us the way back to where we left our stuff and so we never forget where our stuff is. 

## What it does
When the user wants to find their way back to their original spot, they start our app. The app will track where the user is going and place "breadcrumbs" along the path they walked. When the user wants to return to their place, they hold their phone up and follow the breadcrumbs back. 

## How I built it
We used Android ARCore to display the AR features and Unity to build the 3d models. Fuse to build the human models. 

## Challenges I ran into
None of us had experience using AR with Android. Anyone on our team that was familiar with Android development were familiar with Android studio and not Unity. We were experimenting with different AR technologies like Vuforia and ARCore and after spending lots of fiddling around those two technologies, we ultimately chose ARCore due to it's ease of use and good documentation. 

We also had problems with compatibility issues, we know what ARKit for Apple phones has plenty of documentation but we couldn't use it because we did not have enough Apple phones. 

We also ran into problems with compatibility issues of Android Studio and Unity. Merely setting up the project making sure they worked on all computers that we were working on was a problem.   

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
*TBD* We kept changing our mind about what app to make because we kept finding roadblocks along the way. 

## What I learned
AR is tough. We learned how to use Unity. 

## What's next for Living Philadelphia
Make the breadcrumbs customizable and you can make them into different things.
